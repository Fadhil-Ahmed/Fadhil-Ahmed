## 👋 About Me

Hey there! I'm Fadhil Ahmed — an electrical engineering enthusiast who thrives at the intersection of **software and hardware**. I love exploring how code can bring physical systems to life, and I'm especially passionate about **automation**, **embedded systems**, and **data-driven design**.

Whether it's programming a microcontroller to automate tasks or analyzing sensor data in Python, I'm all about creating seamless and smart interactions between the digital and physical world.

### 🔧 Interests:
- Embedded systems and microcontrollers (8051, Arduino, etc.)
- Automation and control systems
- Signal processing and audio systems
- Data analytics and machine learning (currently learning!)
- Full-stack prototyping (from hardware to web interfaces)
- Communications systems and real-world applications

### 🌱 Currently learning:
- SQL & JavaScript for full-stack dev
- TensorFlow and machine learning basics
- Advanced circuit simulation and system modeling
